        Description :
        
            Pygments
            ~~~~~~~~
        
            Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.
        
            It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
            such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
            source code. Highlights are:
        
            * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
            * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
            * support for new languages and formats are added easily
            * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image       formats that PIL supports and ANSI sequences
            * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
            * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!
        
            The `Pygments tip`_ is installable with ``easy_install Pygments==dev``.
